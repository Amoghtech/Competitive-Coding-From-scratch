    Arrays (part-1) tutorial (starting with basic questions)

In this video I have discussed some basic questions on arrays so anyone who want to learn the implementation part must watch and learn how we built our logic step by step.

    Arrays (part-3) tutorial (Pre-Sum technique to calculate query range questions)

In this video I have discussed how we can do some of the range-query questions without using segment tree and in O(N) complexity. Its a very Important concept which is used in many other questions as well.
