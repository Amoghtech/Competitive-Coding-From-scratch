    Do study about the below mentioned STL data structures and inbuilt function

    Some of the important STL are :-
    
1. Vectors :-

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size. Just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for their   elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed using offsets on regular pointers to its elements, and just as efficiently as in arrays. But unlike   arrays, their size can change dynamically, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

vector < type > variable_name;


2. Maps :-

Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value. In a map, the key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key. The types of key and mapped value may differ. Map containers are generally slower than unordered_map containers to access individual elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order.

map < type_1, typr_2 > variable_name;

3. Set :-

Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order. In a set, the value of an element also identifies it (the value is itself the key, of type T), and each value must be unique. The value of the elements in a set cannot be modified once in the container (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed from the container.

set < type > variable_name;

3. List :-

Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions. List containers are implemented as doubly-linked lists; Doubly linked lists can store each of the elements they contain in different and unrelated storage locations. The ordering is kept internally by the association to each element of a link to the element preceding it and a link to the element following it. 
They are very similar to forward_list: The main difference being that forward_list objects are single-linked lists, and thus they can only be iterated forwards, in exchange for being somewhat smaller and more efficient. The main drawback of lists and forward_lists compared to these other sequence containers is that they lack direct access to the elements by their position

last < type > variable_name;



4. Stack

5. Queue

6. Deque

7. Priority Queue

8. Bitset

9. Pairs

5. begin()

6. end()

7. rbegin()

8. rend()

9. push()

10. push_back()

11. push_front()

12. pop()

13. pop_back()

14. pop_front()

15. top()

16. front()

17. back()

19. sort()

20. reverse()

21. stoi()
